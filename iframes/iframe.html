<h4 id="a">1. Your booking with British Airways</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">1.1.</span> These (and any terms stated within the eBay auction listing through which you have made this booking) are the booking conditions that apply to your booking. However, they do not apply to any flight bookings on British Airways services (including services operated by our franchisee, code-share and Oneworld partner airlines) unless they are part of a "Package" as defined below in clause 1.3. Where there is any conflict between these booking conditions and any terms stated within the eBay auction listing, these booking conditions shall prevail. </p>

<p><span class="highlight">1.2.</span> In these booking conditions, "we", "us" and "our" refer to British Airways Plc or British Airways Holidays Limited (see Clauses 2.1 and 2.2 below). The registered office for British Airways Plc, company number 1777777, and British Airways Holidays Limited, company number 00554278, is Waterside, PO Box 365, Harmondsworth, UB7 0GB, United Kingdom. We are registered in England. The postal address for British Airways Holidays is Astral Towers, Betts Way, Crawley, West Sussex RH10 9XA, United Kingdom. For local contact details please refer to <a target="_blank" href="https://ba.com ">ba.com </a>, our website.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">1.3.</span> In these booking conditions, a Package means a pre-arranged combination of at least 2 of the following components, at an inclusive price covering a period of more than 24 hours or including overnight accommodation. The components are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport (flight); </li>
<li>Accommodation; </li>
<li>Car rental or Other tourist services not ancillary to the above (e.g. paid transfers, excursions, sightseeing tours, theatre tickets, attractions) accounting for a significant proportion of the package services. </li></ul>
<p>A Package does not include any travel insurance which you purchase with your booking.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">1.4.</span> Any special offers booked may have specific terms and conditions attached, in addition to these booking conditions. Please refer to the promotional literature and check these before booking as once confirmed you are deemed to have accepted them.</p>

<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 

 <h4 id="b">2. General legal provisions and responsibilities</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">2.1.</span> Your contract is governed exclusively by English law and is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales, but not exclusively if you are domiciled elsewhere as detailed in Clauses 2.1.1 to 2.1.7:</p>
<p><span class="highlight">2.1.1.</span> If you are resident in the United Kingdom but outside of England and Wales, then the courts of Scotland or Northern Ireland (depending on your residence) also have jurisdiction.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">2.1.4.</span> If you are a resident in a member state of the European Union (EU) other than the United Kingdom, then the courts of that member state also have jurisdiction.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">2.1.5.</span> If you are a resident of Germany and your travel arrangements commence from Germany, your contract is governed in all aspects by German law, although English is the contractual language.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">2.1.6.</span> If you are a resident of a member state of the European Union (EU) other than the United Kingdom and have booked a Package, your contract is governed in all aspects by English law but you will have the benefit of any mandatory rules of law applicable in your country of residence.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">2.1.7.</span> If you are a resident of Italy, then the courts of your place of residence or domicile have exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">2.2.</span> If you are a resident of the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal or Italy and have booked a Package, your contract will be with British Airways Holidays. In the case of a Package booked by a person resident outside the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal or Italy, your contract will be with British Airways Plc.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">2.3.</span> The booking conditions apply equally to you and to all persons named in your booking.  Where you make a booking on behalf of other people, it is your responsibility as their agent to bring these booking conditions to their attention and ensure that they have read them.  We rely on the fact that, in making the booking on behalf of all persons named in your booking, you have done this.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">2.4.</span> The law regarding accommodation for persons with disabilities varies from country to country and we cannot guarantee that all hotels, transport and amenities will be equipped and suitable for wheelchair users or disabled persons.  British Airways Holidays will provide assistance to persons with disabilities if such services have been expressly agreed to provide the assistance requested by the customer.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">2.5.</span> If you have special requests, these must be requested as soon as is reasonably practicable after booking. Please note that while we do our best to fulfil special requests and advise the supplier of your preferences these cannot be guaranteed. Special requests may be subject to additional charges which are payable locally direct to the supplier.</p>

<h4 id="c">3. When your contract comes into force</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">3.1.</span> This Clause does not apply to travel insurance. Travel insurance is dealt with in Clause 14.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">3.2.</span> As you have booked with us via eBay, your contract with us will come into force after completion of full payment via PayPal</p>

<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 

 <h4 id="d">4. Financial Protection and Package Bonding Arrangements</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">4.1.</span> If you booked in the United Kingdom a Package (as defined in Clause 1.3) which includes a flight element or booked outside the United Kingdom a Package that has the first departure point from the United Kingdom, you will receive a confirmation invoice from us confirming your arrangements and your protection under Air Travel Organiser's Licence number 5985. In the unlikely event of our insolvency, the Civil Aviation Authority will ensure that you are not stranded abroad and will arrange to refund any money you have paid us for an advance booking. For further information visit the ATOL website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.caa.co.uk/atol-protection/">www.atol.org.uk</a>.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">4.1.1.</span> Your Financial Protection.  When you buy an ATOL protected flight inclusive holiday from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate.  This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">4.1.2.</span> We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative).  In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you).  You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder.  However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).</p>
<p><span class="highlight">4.1.3.</span> If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may take a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme.  You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable).  You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.</p>

	<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 

<h4 id="e">5. Booking and payments</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">5.1.</span> When you make a booking via eBay we will ask you to pay the price in full by PayPal, within 48 hours of auction end.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">5.1.2.</span> If we do not receive this payment in full and on time, we reserve the right to re-list the package and/or make a second chance offer to the next highest bidder. Only British Airways may re-list the package, it may not be offered on eBay by any other users</p>

<p><span class="highlight">5.2.</span> You will receive an email from PayPal following completion of payment which serves as confirmation of your booking.  We will then provide further details of your itinerary by post and e-ticket receipts will be sent to you by email in advance of your travel date.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">5.3.</span> You should check carefully the booking details and all documentation provided to you (including these booking conditions) and contact us immediately if you think any details we give you are inaccurate.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">5.4.</span> Only we, the person who makes or pays for the booking, those individuals whose names appear in the booking and will be using the services and, when travel insurance is purchased, those persons referred to in Clause 14 shall have any rights to enforce any of these booking conditions. Except as stated in Clause 14, and in accordance with Clause 2.3, only we and the person who makes the booking, or payment, may cancel or change it or any part of it and the consent of any other persons whose names appear on the booking is not required for any such change or cancellation.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">5.5.</span> The person who makes or pays for the booking must be at least 21 years old. In addition, to comply with local policies, at least one person in each room must be at least 21 years old.</p>

<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 

<h4 id="f"> 6. The price </h4>

Once at the hotel or apartment, should you wish to check-in earlier or check-out later, you may be able to do this for a charge payable locally, subject to availability. If you wish to guarantee an earlier arrival or later departure, we suggest you pre-book an extra night with us before you travel. Most hotels and apartments will allow you to leave your luggage in reception or their luggage room should you not have access to your room.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">6.3.</span> When you book a Package as defined in clause 1.3, at a single all-inclusive price, we are unable, for commercial reasons, to provide a price breakdown of the individual components of the Package.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">6.5.</span> No Avios will be awarded for this package. </p>
<p><span class="highlight">6.6.</span> British Airways Holidays Ltd is a Tour Operator based in the UK and therefore accounts for VAT under the Tour Operator Margin Scheme (TOMS) as required by HMRC (Revenue and Customs), we therefore cannot issue VAT invoices.</p>

<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 
 
<h4 id="g">7. Changes or cancellations by you</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">7.1.</span> To cancel your booking or to request an amendment to your existing itinerary, you will need to contact us by emailing <span class="highlight">auctions@ba.com </span></p>

<p><span class="highlight">7.2.</span> Amendments to your booking:</p>
<p><span class="highlight">7.2.1.</span> As the one-off package you have booked is for pre-arranged travel dates and services, amendments to this itinerary are not possible.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">7.2.2.</span> If you are a resident of the EU purchasing a Package, you are allowed (under the European Directive of Package Travel, Package Holidays, and Package Tours 1990) to amend individuals' names, subject to an amendment fee, and any additional charges made by the suppliers of the services (e.g. airline, hotel,  experience provider or transfer provider) to make the changes, which will be advised at time of enquiry. Any changes of the individuals named in the booking are conditional on the substitute individual accepting these booking conditions and otherwise satisfying all the conditions applicable to the Package. Name changes within 7 days of departure are not guaranteed.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">7.2.3.</span> Re-listing the package you have booked on eBay is not permitted and any name changes must be agreed directly between us, the individuals named in the booking and the transferee </p>
<p><span class="highlight">7.2.4.</span> If you are not a resident of the European Union, we do not permit name changes. This means any name change is treated as a cancellation</p>
<p><span class="highlight">7.3.</span> Cancellation of your booking:</p>
<p><span class="highlight">7.3.1.</span> If you cancel any part of your booking after your contract comes into existence, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The one-off package you have booked is non-changeable and non-refundable, therefore no refunds are payable to you if you cancel any part of your itinerary or the package in its entirety.</li></ul>

<p><span class="highlight">7.3.2.</span> In the event of cancellation, application for a refund of taxes,  must be made within a month from the last flight departure date.</p>

<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 
 
<h4 id="h">8. Changes or cancellation by us</h4>

<p><span class="highlight">8.1.</span> It is unlikely that we will have to change or cancel your booking. If we do make changes then we will inform the person who made the booking as soon as we reasonably can. We reserve the right to make changes that are not significant and to correct minor or obvious errors in your booking details at any time without liability to you.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">8.2.</span> We will take reasonable steps to avoid having to cancel your booking. In the unlikely event that we are to cancel your booking we will notify you and we will provide a full refund.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">8.3.</span> We are only liable to you for cancellations or significant changes to your booking by us. A significant change is one that we make to your booking before your departure that affects an essential term of your contract. Examples of a significant change includes changes by us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>your destination area; </li>
<li>your booked accommodation to that of an alternative property of a lower rating; </li>
<li>your departure times or accommodation occupancy periods by more than 12 hours. </li>
</ol>

<p><span class="highlight">8.4.</span> Where your booking includes accommodation and/or a flight please note that the following is not a significant change:</p>
<ul>

<li>A change of rating for the accommodation where the quality of the accommodation has not changed significantly since the time of the booking and the facilities are substantially as set out on our website or equivalent; </li>
<li>A change in the accommodation where substitute accommodation is offered in a similar location and at least equivalent quality (at no additional cost to you); </li>
<li>A change in the particular type of room booked where the substitute room is of at least equivalent quality. </li>
<li>A change to your flight departure time(s) where the revised or substitute departure time is less than 12 hours difference to the departing time. </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="highlight">8.5.</span> We are not liable to pay you compensation even for significant changes to your booking if Clause 11.3 applies.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">8.6.</span> If we make a significant change to your booking then, whether compensation is payable or not, you have a choice. You may:</p>
<ol>
<li>1.	accept the significant change; or </li>
<li>2.	accept substitute arrangements of equivalent or superior quality if we are able to offer this to you; or </li>
<li>3.	accept substitute arrangements of lower quality if we are able to offer this to you together with a refund of the difference in price between the original and the substitute arrangements; or </li>
<li>4.	cancel your booking altogether, in which case we will process a refund in full of all money you have paid us for the booking within 7 days of your request.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="highlight">8.7.</span> You must tell us which one of the above choices (under Clause 8.6) you make within 7 days of being informed of the significant change we are making, or as soon as reasonably practicable if your departure is less than 7 days from the date you receive notification. If we do not receive notification from you about your choice you are deemed to have accepted the option in Clause 8.6(1) above.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">8.8.</span> Unless Clause 11.2 applies, you agree that if a significant change is made to your booking, whichever choice you make under Clause 8.6 above, we will only pay you for losses which may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally (that is, according to the usual course of things) from the significant change we make.</p>

<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 

<h4 id="i">9. Your responsibilities</h4>

<p><span class="highlight">9.1. Behaviour</span></p><p>

If, in our reasonable opinion or the reasonable opinion of the provider of any part of the services to which your booking relates, you are behaving in a way which will cause or is likely to cause danger or distress or annoyance to others or damage to property, we may terminate your booking. If this happens, we will not pay you anything and you will be responsible for travel back to your point of origin. If we incur expense as a result of your behaviour you shall fully compensate us for that expense.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">9.2. Insurance</span></p><p>
For your own protection, we strongly recommend that you and all members of your party have suitable insurance (including insurance to cover the costs of cancellation of your holiday and the costs of assisting you if you or your party has an accident or becomes ill) for the full period of your holiday. Please note it is your responsibility to ensure the insurance you purchase is suitable and adequate for your particular needs. See Clause 14.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">9.3. Passport and Visas</span>
<p><span class="highlight">9.3.1.</span> You must ensure that you have a valid passport and any necessary visas to enter any country you are visiting, including transit stops, prior to your departure.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.3.2.</span> If you are a British citizen, we shall provide you with general information about passport and visa requirements for the Package you purchase.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.3.3.</span> If you are not a British citizen but you are a citizen of the European Union, further details of passport and visa requirements can be obtained by contacting Thames Consular on telephone number <span class="highlight">+44 (0) 20 7494 4957</span>. If you are not a citizen of the European Union then you will need to make your own enquiries. We are not responsible or liable to you if you fail to follow the correct procedures. You shall reimburse any penalties or expenses that we or the relevant carrier incurs as a result of your failure to travel with appropriate travel documents.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.3.4.</span> Information about which visa you need can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iatatravelcentre.com">www.iatatravelcentre.com</a> or by checking with the country's embassy you are visiting.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">9.4. Health & Safety</span>
<p><span class="highlight">9.4.1.</span> It is your responsibility to ensure that you are fit to travel and participate in all parts of the services you have booked and undertake. It is also your responsibility to ensure that you can prove you have any necessary vaccinations for your travel arrangements. Consult your doctor about any health requirements for all destinations to which you are travelling before your departure. We are not liable if you are refused entry to any country or part of a country because you cannot prove that you have the necessary vaccinations or because you do not comply with the health requirements of your destinations.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.4.2.</span> Without prejudice to 9.4.1 above, if you are a citizen of the European Union, please note that you may be eligible for the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.4.3.</span> Should you need to take any medication with you, it is your responsibility to check before travel that you are allowed to take it into the country you are visiting, as some countries do not permit certain medicines which may be widely accepted in your own country. You must also ensure you take any required paperwork or authorisation from your Doctor that may be required.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.4.4.</span> When travelling to a different country, you should take responsibility for your own safety and well being as you would do at home. Examples would be (but not exhaustive) to ensure you secure any valuable possessions, do not leave children unsupervised on balconies or swimming pools, beaches are safe for swimming, adhere to any local laws and familiarise yourself with fire procedures for the accommodation in which you are staying. In some countries due to hotter climates and restaurants which are open sided, it is a way of life to have insects, small lizards, or birds visiting, and is not a reflection on the standards of hygiene and cleanliness. However, you should take sensible precautions especially with raw food, drinking bottled water, covering yourself up or applying insect repellent. You should also be aware that when travelling a change in climate or very cold drinks may result in an upset stomach, which is not necessarily the result of poor hygiene or food preparation.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.4.5.</span> We recommend that all British travellers check the Foreign and Commonwealth office website to help stay safe overseas, and to make informed decisions about travelling abroad. It has essential travel advice and tips and up to date information relating to specific countries; <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice</a>. You can also call the travel advice call centre on 0845 850 2829. For nationals of other countries, please check with your own government's travel advice.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.4.6.</span> For further safety-related travel advice, we strongly recommend you visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/travel-advice ">http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/travel-advice </a>
<p><span class="highlight">9.5.</span> Please be aware that some suppliers may authorise or charge your payment card at check-in as a deposit for incidentals during your stay.  The amount authorised or charged can vary considerably depending on the supplier and/or which country you are in.  It is your responsibility to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover the amount required by the supplier.  Some suppliers will take a cash deposit for customers who do not have a payment card.  We are not responsible for setting the amount of any deposit and any concerns should be addressed to the relevant supplier, prior to departure.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.6.1.</span> It is your responsibility to arrange any transportation you may require to London Heathrow for your outbound journey (for example domestic flights). You must also ensure all such arrangements allow sufficient time for connection in London Heathrow, which may include collecting luggage and checking in for the flight to New Orleans (MSY).</p>
<p><span class="highlight">9.6.2.</span> The one-off package you have booked is based on fixed flights to and from New Orleans (MSY). As such, if you do not arrive in sufficient time to board your outbound or return flight you will be responsible for any further travel arrangements to continue with your trip, or (in the event of missing your outbound journey) cancel your package under Clause 7. </p>

 <h4 id="j">10. Limitation of Liability </h4>
<p><span class="highlight">10.1.</span> Whilst British Airways Plc, its subsidiaries and affiliates endeavours to ensure that the information displayed on <a target="_blank" href="https://ba.com ">ba.com </a> relating to hotel, car hire and other travel products (including without limitation, photographs, descriptions of amenities, locations and maps, etc.) is accurate and up to date, they cannot guarantee the accuracy and therefore disclaim liability for any inaccuracies relating to the information and description of the hotel, car rental and other travel products displayed on <a target="_blank" href="https://ba.com ">ba.com </a> (including, without limitation, photographs, description of hotel amenities, general product descriptions, location maps etc).
In the event of a significant change relating to the information and description displayed, we will make best efforts to update the relevant information/descriptions and/or notify you of such changes.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">10.2.</span> Whilst we endeavour to ensure that the products, services, amenities, facilities and descriptions on our website offer accurate and up to date information, we obtain this information from our suppliers and so cannot guarantee this always to be the case. The information is given to provide a feel for the product you have booked. Whilst we constantly strive to achieve the highest standards of accuracy, we cannot be held responsible or liable if such content is found to be inaccurate.  In the event that a significant change relating to the information and description displayed is notified to us by our suppliers, we will make best efforts to update the relevant information/descriptions and/or notify you of such changes.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">10.3.</span> There is no consistent global system of hotel and accommodation star ratings. Different countries have different standards; a 3 star hotel in one country is not necessarily equivalent to a 3 star hotel in another. Therefore we have set our own star ratings to provide a standard which can be compared globally and offer them as a general guide only. However, these are not necessarily the official local rating and you should be aware that standards can vary between hotels and accommodation of the same class in different countries and even in the same country.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">10.4.</span> Changes are periodically added to the information held on our website and will reflect the latest information with which we have been provided. We will do our best to correct errors and omissions as quickly as practicable after being notified of them.</p>

<a href="#index">Back to top</a> 

 <h4 id="k">11. Our liability</h4>

<p><span class="highlight">11.1.</span> Subject to Clauses 11.3 to 11.11, we accept liability to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of Packages, if any of the component parts of the booking you made with us are not provided or not provided as booked; </li>
<li>In the case of Packages, if the services we or our suppliers provide are not of a reasonable standard. Reasonable standards are judged by the standards applicable in the place where the relevant part of the booking is provided; </li>
<li>for the acts of our employees, agents and subcontractors, as long as they were at the time carrying out work we authorised; </li>
<li>if you or any member of your party dies, is injured or becomes ill arising from negligence because we or our suppliers failed to act with reasonable care; </li>
<li>if we have deliberately misrepresented anything to you before you entered into this booking which then caused you to make the booking. </li>
</ul>

<p>While (save in the case of Packages) we accept no responsibility for the standard of care in the supply of services by third party service providers, we will exercise reasonable skill and care in the organisation, co-ordination, facilitation and selection of service providers to provide the component parts of the booking.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">11.2.</span> Unless Clause 11.3 applies, you agree that, if a significant change is made to your booking, which ever choice you make under Clause 8.6 above, you will be entitled to receive on account of your losses the minimum compensation amounts set out in the table below per booking, depending on when we notify you of the change. We will only pay you for losses which may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally (that is according to the usual course of things) from any significant change we make.</p>
<table bordercolor="#aeb2b7" border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
			<tr><td style="width: 300px;"><b>Period before your Departure</b></td><td style="width: 300px;"><b>Minimum compensation per booking (or local currency equivalent)</b></td></tr>

			<tr><td>0-48 hours</td><td>£100</td></tr>
		</table>

<p><span class="highlight">11.3.</span> We are not liable to pay you compensation if we or our supplier(s) are hindered from providing part or all of your booking, or if there is any failing in performance of any part of your booking, due to unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control or that of our agents, suppliers or subcontractors that could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised or due to an event that we or our agents, suppliers or subcontractors could not (even with all due care) have foreseen or prevented. The circumstances and events referred to above include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>war or the threat of war; </li>
<li>riot or civil disturbance; </li>

<p><span class="highlight">11.4.</span> We only accept liability in any event for loss or damage which is caused by us or the supplier of any part of your booking and which is of a kind which could reasonably have been expected at the time the booking was made. We are not liable for any additional services for which you pay our suppliers separately since these do not form part of the booking.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">11.5.</span> We do not accept liability where any failure to provide any services in accordance with the contract or any other form of loss or damage is due to your own fault or that of any party named on your booking, including any failure to comply with your obligations in this contract, or is the result of our compliance with any instruction, request or direction given by you.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">11.6.</span> We or our representatives may arrange for you to purchase trips or excursions or other services or facilities after you have departed for your holiday locally in-resort.  If you have a contract direct with the person or company providing the trips, excursions, services or facilities and any such extra items do not form part of your booking with us, in the unlikely event that you have any problem arising out of a trip, excursion or other service or facility that does not form part of your pre-arranged booking your rights are against the person providing the trip, excursion or other service or facility and will be governed by their booking conditions.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">11.7.</span> You should make any complaints or claims in accordance with Clause 12 below. If we pay you or agree to pay you compensation you must give us or our insurers all the rights you have to take action against anyone else and you agree to provide us and our insurers with all due co-operation and assistance in respect of any such action we or our insurers take.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">11.8.</span> Air, sea, rail and road transport is subject to various international conventions that limit the liability of the carriers. Our liability is limited in accordance with all such international conventions to the extent to which they apply. A copy of the convention applicable to most international air carriage is available for purchase through the International Civil Aviation Organisation on <span class="highlight">+44 (0)161 499 0023</span> or for download on the internet at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jus.uio.no/lm/air.carriage.unification.convention.montreal.1999/">www.jus.uio.no/lm/air.carriage.unification.convention.montreal.1999/</a>. Additionally, your booking may be serviced by carriers, hotels, and other parties who have their own booking conditions of carriage and business and over whom we may have no direct control. Their booking conditions may strictly limit the circumstances in which compensation is payable to you by them and you agree to be bound by their booking conditions. Copies of their booking conditions are available on request.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">11.9.</span> Except in cases of death, injury or illness, our liability is limited to a maximum of three times (five times in Portugal) your booking price attributable to the person affected. This maximum applies where everything possible has gone wrong and you prove that no benefit or enjoyment has been obtained. In all other circumstances we agree to pay compensation that is reasonable and proportionate for the reduction in value of your booking and any loss of enjoyment you prove subject to the above maximum.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">11.10.</span> If you encounter significant problems that are not our responsibility and/or are the result of something that happens other than in the course of the booking set out in your e-ticket receipt or confirmation letter as a result of which you suffer death, injury or illness, we will offer you reasonable and prompt assistance including assistance in sorting out any problem with the person responsible. This assistance is limited in money terms to £5,000 (or equivalent currency) per e-ticket receipt or confirmation letter and you must repay this if you are successful in any claim against the person responsible. You must notify us in writing of the steps that you intend to take against the person responsible within 90 days of the relevant occurrence and obtain our written approval which will not be unreasonably withheld.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">11.11.</span> These booking conditions shall not limit our liability to you for death, injury or illness.</p>

<h4 id="l">12. Complaints and claims</h4>
<p><span class="highlight">12.1.</span> We can usually sort out problems on the spot if we know about them. If you have cause to complain about the land arrangements of your holiday (hotel, transfers, experiences) or any element of your Package, please:</p>
<p>tell the relevant service supplier;</p> 
<p>if the problem cannot be sorted out this way please contact our 24 hour Duty Office on <span class="highlight">+44 (0)20 8707 4461</span>; </p>

<p><span class="highlight">12.2.</span> You should notify us in writing of all complaints as soon as possible and in any event no later than 30 days after your return home. This is to give us a reasonable opportunity to make appropriate enquiries and obtain evidence. If you do not follow this procedure it will make it harder for us to resolve your complaint and this could prejudice any claim for compensation that you wish to make.</p>
